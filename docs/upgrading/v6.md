# Upgrade from 5.x to 6.0.0

This version includes changes to the public API, making it easier to import and use the middleware.

## New: Default Export

### Before

Previously, the middleware need to be instantiated. 

```js
import promise from 'redux-promise-middleware'

applyMiddleware(
  promise({}),
)(createStore)
```

This implementation enabled custom configuration, but it is uncessary overhead for most implementations of the middleware.

### After

With the new version, the default export is ready to go.

```js
import promise from 'redux-promise-middleware'

applyMiddleware(
  promise,
)(createStore)
```

## New: `createPromise` Export

```js
import { createPromise } from 'redux-promise-middleware'
```

Of course, the middleware support custom configuration. If you'd like to create a custom configuration, just import `createPromise` and pass in the configuration object.

### Example

```js
import { createPromise } from 'redux-promise-middleware'

applyMiddleware(
  createPromise({
    // ...
    typeDelimiter: '/',
  }),
)(createStore)
```

## New: `ActionType` Export

```js
import { ActionType } from 'redux-promise-middleware'
```

### Before

```js
import { PENDING, FULFILLED, REJECTED } from 'redux-promise-middleware'
```
